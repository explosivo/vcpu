vcpu:
  virtual cpu. instructions are 16-bit.

note:
  this is an old project from 2015 that was started and quickly
  abandoned.  the vcpu works but should be redesigned.
  the assembler is currently incomplete and broken.

  recently, i've been occasionally working on this project again
  even though i have better things to be doing.  i don't know if
  i think this project is fun or if i'm just putting off my real
  projects and homework.

registers:
  there are 8 registers, r0 to r7.

i know the isa is currently trash. this is it for now
opcodes:
  let a, b, and c refer to registers
  let n be any number

  add: 0x0abc
  sub: 0x1abc
  mul: 0x2abc
  div: 0x3abc
  jmp: 0x4abc
  set: 0x5ann
  mov: 0x60ab
